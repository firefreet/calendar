# Day Planner

A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 

The app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot represents one hour and contains the following:

* The time

* A field to hold user input

* A save button

Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in `localStorage`.
